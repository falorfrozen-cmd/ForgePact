# Toggle skills — research log (issue #11)

Status (2026-09-17): **instrument built, not yet run.** Nothing about toggle
skills has been measured in-game by this toolkit. The research build carries
`tgprobe`, one batched instrument for every candidate the static search below
turned up; the live session in "Live procedure" has not happened, so
Results and Decision are empty. Every statement about the game's
behaviour below is either a static-search fact (a name exists or does not) or
labelled as inference.

## The issue

[ForgePact#11](https://github.com/falorfrozen-cmd/ForgePact/issues/11),
"[QoL] Better toggle skills", verbatim:

> Toggle skills can be double casted by accident and don't have any indicator
> if they are on. Adding small cooldown and an animated (or not animated)
> border could make this easier.

The author's clarification (2026-09-17), verbatim:

> White mage's soul spurn skill has an upgrade (skill tree) called purgatory.
> This upgrade turns skill into a toggled skill meaning it doesn't have a
> duration anymore or its duration is infinite. Doesn't look like there's a
> special tag for it so maybe skills which apply their effect continuously
> when cast (toggled) til other are casted again could be "toggle skills".
> Definitely not auras since they have a special tag and can only be equipped
> in a special "active aura" slot in character skills.

And:

> Toggle skills cast their effect continuously when cast (toggled) and stop
> only when casted again or on zone change.

Two mods are wanted, both off by default: a **re-cast guard** (a second press
of a toggle skill within a short window after switching it on is dropped) and
an **active indicator** (a border over every skill-bar slot whose toggle is
currently on, gone on the first frame after a zone change). Neither can be
designed until the questions in Results are answered.

## Static search

Skills are **talents** throughout `hs-game-sdk`: the hotbar slot object is
`UI_Hud_Talent_obj`, the cast routines are `TalentUse*`, and skill-tree
upgrades are **sub-talents** (`GetSubTalentInfo`, `ReturnSubTalentLevel`).
Searched with `grep -i` over `hs-game-sdk/cpp/include/hs_game_sdk/scripts.hpp`,
`objects.hpp`, `python/hs_game_sdk/sprites.py` and the object hierarchy. The
SDK tables are complete for names, so a negative here is *not present*, not
merely *not observed* — but the absence of a name says nothing about behaviour.

| Looking for | Result | Label |
|---|---|---|
| any script named `*Purgat*` | none | not present (static, complete) |
| any script named `*Spurn*` / `*SoulSpurn*` | none — the White Mage's per-talent bodies are not separate scripts | not present (static, complete) |
| objects named `*Soul_Spurn*` | `White_Mage_Soul_Spurn_obj` (5761) → parent `Player_Ability_Parent_obj` (3536); `White_Mage_Soul_Spurn_AOE_obj` (5759) → parent `Player_Damage_Parent_obj`; `White_Mage_Soul_Spurn_Damaging_obj` (5760) → parent `Player_Damage_Parent_obj` | found (SDK parent table) |
| anonymous closures on any Soul Spurn object, `Skill_Controller_obj`, `Player_Buff_Parent_obj`, `Player_Ability_Parent_obj` | none | not present (static, complete) |
| the White Mage talent dispatch | `gml_Script_TalentsWhiteMage` (3797), `gml_Script_TalentsUniversal` (3825); `PopulateTalentStructMapWhiteMage` fills the talent table at load, not at cast | found |
| scripts/objects/sprites named `*Toggle*` relating to skills | only `QuestToggleVisibility`, `UiABloodPactCharacterToggle`, `UiAMarketFilterToggleStat` | not present |
| a persist / infinite / duration family | `ClearPersistSkill`, `StepAbilityParentDestroyTimer`, `PlayerUpdateTimers`; nothing named `*Infinite*` / `*Duration*` / `*Continuous*` | found (names only; behaviour not observed) |
| skill tags | `LoadSkillTagsString` is the only tag script; its output for Soul Spurn is not observed | found |
| room / zone change routines | `RoomGoto`, `NetworkRoomGoto`, `NetworkRoomSetupDone`, `CA_playerRoomSetupDone`, `SetupRoomEffects`; no script named `*ZoneChange*` / `*RoomStart*` / `*RoomEnd*` | found |
| sprites | `Ability_Indicator_Border_spr` (21), `Hud_Talents_spr` | found |
| the aura family | `LoadAura*`, `skillsAura` | found, and ruled out as the centre by the author (auras are tagged and slot-restricted); two rows stay in the probe as negative controls |

**Working hypothesis (inference, not observed).** `White_Mage_Soul_Spurn_obj`
is a `Player_Ability_Parent_obj` descendant, and that parent has a named
per-step destroy timer. "No duration" is then most simply the Purgatory
sub-talent leaving the effect instance alive with its destroy timer disabled,
and "stops on zone change" needs no cleanup routine at all, because GameMaker
destroys every non-persistent instance when the room changes. That would make
the toggle's state *the existence of a live effect instance*, readable at any
moment and automatically correct on the first frame of a new zone. The
alternatives the instrument must also be able to see: a `global.playerBuff`
slot with no expiry, or a scalar on `Player_obj`.

### Candidate scripts hooked by `tgprobe`

Every row is an `hs-game-sdk` constant; all of them are hooked in one build
behind one command.

| Group | Constant | Logged |
|---|---|---|
| cast entry | `gml_Script_TalentUse` | args + ret (ret native only) |
| cast entry | `gml_Script_TalentUseClass` | args |

| sub-talent lookup (the Purgatory read) | `gml_Script_GetSubTalentInfo`, `gml_Script_ReturnSubTalentLevel` | args + ret |
| tags (confirms "no tag") | `gml_Script_LoadSkillTagsString` | args + ret |

| buff state | `gml_Script_GetBuff` | count (hot) |
| zone change | `gml_Script_RoomGoto`, `gml_Script_NetworkRoomGoto`, `gml_Script_NetworkRoomSetupDone`, `gml_Script_CA_playerRoomSetupDone`, `gml_Script_SetupRoomEffects` | args |
| HUD | `gml_Script_DrawHudAbilityButtons`, `gml_Script_DrawHudBuffs`, `gml_Script_DrawHud`, `gml_Script_GetPlayerTalentHudObj`, `gml_Script_UiHudTalentNavigation`, `gml_Script_DrawKeyBindSprites` | args |
| HUD closures (every closure split out of the slot object's Create event) | `gml_Script_anon_1183_gml_Object_UI_Hud_Talent_obj_Create_0`, `gml_Script_anon_2413_gml_Object_UI_Hud_Talent_obj_Create_0`, `gml_Script_anon_10430_gml_Object_UI_Hud_Talent_obj_Create_0`, `gml_Script_anon_11283_gml_Object_UI_Hud_Talent_obj_Create_0`, `gml_Script_anon_11677_gml_Object_UI_Hud_Talent_obj_Create_0`, `gml_Script_anon_12084_gml_Object_UI_Hud_Talent_obj_Create_0`, `gml_Script_anon_12530_gml_Object_UI_Hud_Talent_obj_Create_0`, `gml_Script_anon_13033_gml_Object_UI_Hud_Talent_obj_Create_0` | args |
| positive control | `gml_Script_CheckPlayerInteraction` | count |
| input | `gml_Script_InputPressed` | count (hot) |
| negative control | `gml_Script_LoadAura`, `gml_Script_skillsAura` | count; must not move on a Soul Spurn cast |

Object events, by runtime name `gml_Object_<Obj>_<Event>` built from the SDK's
object name (the SDK has no event table, so `not found` means the object has
no such event):

| Object | Events |
|---|---|
| `White_Mage_Soul_Spurn_obj` (5761) | `Create_0 Step_0 Destroy_0 CleanUp_0 Alarm_0` |
| `Player_Ability_Parent_obj` (3536) | `Create_0 Step_0 Destroy_0 CleanUp_0` |
| `Draw_Player_Buff_obj` (1362) | `Create_0 Destroy_0` |
| `UI_Hud_Talent_obj` (5099) | `Create_0 Step_0 Draw_0 Draw_64` |
| `Skill_Controller_obj` (4606) | `Create_0 Step_0` |

`Step_0` rows are count only.

**No Room Start or Room End row, on any object.** Hooking the room start
event has crashed the game before, and `tests/test_est_force_behavior.py`
(`test_room_start_is_not_hooked`) keeps any such token out of the plugin
source; `tests/test_toggle_skill_contract.py` additionally forbids the two
GameMaker event suffixes for Room Start and Room End inside the `tgprobe`
block. That guard is left exactly as it is. What a zone change does (Q6) is
read instead from the room key changing (`tgprobe show`'s `room=` and
`hudSinceRoomChange=`) together with the Soul Spurn object's `Destroy_0` /
`CleanUp_0` rows.

## Instrument

`tgprobe` is **research build only** (`plugin_build\build.bat dev`,
`BloodPactPlugin_rel.dll`); it is not in `kPlayerCommands` and every trace of
it, including the three entry notes below, is inside `#ifndef
FORGEPACT_RELEASE`. It is read-only: nothing it does writes game state. Its
shape is `citrace nativetrace`'s — a native detour per row that counts,
optionally logs and calls through its trampoline — with its own resolver.
Pinned by `tests/test_toggle_skill_contract.py`.

### How a row attaches

Four rows are already hooked by ForgePact before `tgprobe hook` can run:
`DrawHudBuffs` (the head-label hook, installed at init in every build),
`BuffAdd` (the buff logger, installed by the research build's setup at frame
300), `TalentUse` (the co-op skill block, only if co-op rendering was turned
on) and `CheckPlayerInteraction` (only if a `citrace` command ran). ForgePact's
installer puts its hook body in the script table and keeps a trampoline as the
"original"; neither is code inside `Hero_Siege.exe`, and the game's own bytes
already carry a patch, so such a row cannot be detoured a second time. The
resolver, per row, in fixed order:

- (a) resolve the runtime name; nothing there → `not found`.
- (b) the table entry is code inside `Hero_Siege.exe` → nobody in this module
  holds it → native detour → `native`.
- (c) a ForgePact hook holds the table and its saved original is code inside
  `Hero_Siege.exe` → that hook is table-only, so its original is the game
  body → native detour on it → `native (under table-only <hook>)`.
- (d) a ForgePact hook holds the table with a trampoline, and that hook's body
  carries an entry note → no detour; counted by the note →
  `via <hook> (native)`. If (c)'s detour fails on a note row, the note is the
  fallback and the mode reads `via <hook> (TABLE-ONLY; …)`.
- (e) anything else → `blocked: table entry is not code inside Hero_Siege.exe`
  (for example `CheckPlayerInteraction` after `citrace nativetrace`).
- (f) the hooking library refuses → `blocked: MmCreateHook st=<n>`.

Every pointer handed to the hooking library has just been checked with
`AddrIsExecutableInModule`, and the hooking library is called from one place.
The entry notes are one research-only line at the top of `Hook_DrawHudBuffs`,
`HookTalentUse` (before the co-op puppet early return, so a puppet's calls
would be counted too; a single-player session has no puppet) and
`HookBuffAdd`. Each does nothing unless its row attached `via` that hook, so a
row with its own detour is never counted twice. A note cannot see the return
value, so a `via` row prints `ret=n/a (via hook)`.

**Consequence for the session:** a row attached natively by `tgprobe` makes a
*later* ForgePact install on the same routine degrade to table-only. Do not
turn co-op rendering on, and run no `citrace` command, after `tgprobe hook`.

### Subcommands

| Command | Prints |
|---|---|
| `tgprobe hook [substr…]` | Attaches every row whose label contains any given substring (none = all); rows already attached are left alone. First line `tgprobe hook: N native, P via hook, B blocked, F not found`, then one line per row that is not plain `native`, naming its mode and reason. |
| `tgprobe show` | One line per row: `<label> mode=<mode> calls=N lastFrame=F lastGap=G`. `lastGap` is the number of frames between the last two calls (0 = same frame). A row that is not attached (unhooked, `blocked`, `not found`) prints `calls=n/a`, never `0`. A `via … (TABLE-ONLY…)` row is flagged: direct calls bypass it, so a 0 there is *not observed*. Last line: `room=<key> name=<room name> hudSinceRoomChange=<n> hudRoomUnreadable=<n>`. |
| `tgprobe reset` | Zeroes every row's calls, lastFrame, lastGap and log budget. `hudSinceRoomChange` keeps counting. |
| `tgprobe verbose on\|off` | While on, each row flagged for logging writes its first 3 calls since the last `reset` to `out.txt`: `tgprobe <label> #n frame=F self=<Obj#idx@id> other=… argc=N a0=… a1=…` (struct arguments as JSON, each capped at 200 characters), plus `tgprobe <label> #n ret=<value>` for rows that log a return. Count-only rows never log. |
| `tgprobe slots` | Every `UI_Hud_Talent_obj` instance (cap 16): id, `x`, `y`, `sprite_index` and its sprite name, `sprite_width/height`, `image_xscale/yscale`, then every custom variable; the GUI size. |
| `tgprobe buffs` | `global.playerBuff[1][0]`, walked the way `HhBuffAlive` reads it: every non-empty slot's index, value kind, `instance_exists`, object name, and for up to 8 live instances their custom variables. |
| `tgprobe abilities` | Every live `Player_Ability_Parent_obj` instance including descendants (cap 64): object name, id, `alarm[0..11]`, then every custom variable. The Q2/Q3/Q6 read for the working hypothesis. |
| `tgprobe vars <Obj\|global>` | Scalar variables (real/int/bool/string) of the first instance of `<Obj>`, or of the global scope. |
| `tgprobe snap <Obj\|global>` / `tgprobe diff` | Snapshot those scalars, then print changed / added / removed keys (cap 200 lines). A change inside an array or struct is invisible here; that is what the walkers are for. |
| `tgprobe room` | The room key, whether it is readable, and the room name. |

`hudSinceRoomChange` counts `DrawHudBuffs` calls since the room key last
changed, including the first call in the new room. An unreadable room key is
never stored — it is counted in `hudRoomUnreadable` instead — so "unreadable"
cannot compare equal to anything.

**Positive controls, one per attach mode, same session:** native →
`CheckPlayerInteraction(control)` (every interactable's step runs it; thousands
in 2 s under `citrace nativetrace`); via hook → `DrawHudBuffs`, whose count
over a window must equal (±2) the `hudCalls=` delta of two `hhlabel` replies
bracketing that window (`hhlabel` works in both builds). A native `0` with the
native control at 0, or a via `0` with the `hhlabel` cross-check failing,
measures the instrument, not the game.

## Live procedure

Research DLL in `mods/aurie/`, driven with `ForgePact/tools/ipc.ps1`.
Character: White Mage, Soul Spurn with Purgatory allocated on the hotbar, one
non-toggle skill on the hotbar. Start in town or a cleared zone.

1. **Fresh launch** of the research DLL, with no `bp_ipc\coop.ini` (or one
   with `enabled=0`) and **no `citrace` command at any point in the
   session** (see "How a row attaches": both take rows `tgprobe` needs).
   `hhlabel` → record `hudCalls=`. `tgprobe hook` → expect `N native, 2 via
   hook, 0 blocked, F not found` with `DrawHudBuffs` = `via Hook_DrawHudBuffs
   (native)`, `BuffAdd` = `via HookBuffAdd (native)`, `TalentUse` = `native`,
   `CheckPlayerInteraction` = `native`; record every non-native line verbatim.
   If `TalentUse` reads `via HookTalentUse`, co-op was on — say so in Results
   (its counts are still valid). If any `via` row reads `TABLE-ONLY`, or
   `CheckPlayerInteraction` is not `native`, stop and relaunch: the controls
   must attach. An object-event row that is `not found` means the object has
   no such event — a result, not an error.
2. Stand still 2 s. `hhlabel` again, then `tgprobe show` → one control per
   attach mode: `CheckPlayerInteraction` (native) in the thousands;
   `DrawHudBuffs` (via hook) ≈ frames elapsed **and equal (±2) to the
   `hudCalls=` delta between the two `hhlabel` replies** — that agreement is
   what proves the entry-note path counts; the two `negctl` rows ideally 0. If
   either control is 0, nothing measured afterwards counts as a negative. Draw
   order (Q4): `tgprobe verbose on`, `tgprobe reset`, wait one frame,
   `tgprobe show`; the log order of the first verbose lines is the draw order.
   `tgprobe verbose off`.
3. Baseline snapshots: `tgprobe slots`, `tgprobe abilities`, `tgprobe buffs`,
   `tgprobe snap Player_obj`, `tgprobe room`.
4. `tgprobe reset`; `tgprobe verbose on`; press Soul Spurn **once**. Within a
   second: `tgprobe show`, `tgprobe abilities`, `tgprobe buffs`,
   `tgprobe diff`, `tgprobe slots` → Q1 (which rows moved +1 with `self` =
   player; what `TalentUse`/`TalentsWhiteMage`/`GetSubTalentInfo` args were),
   Q2/Q3 (a `White_Mage_Soul_Spurn_obj` alive? its alarms and timer-like
   variables? a buff slot? a `Player_obj` scalar?). Wait 10 s, repeat
   `tgprobe abilities` → still alive = toggled ON persists.
5. `tgprobe snap Player_obj`; press Soul Spurn again (off). Same reads → the
   Q3 signal must flip back (effect gone / buff gone / scalar reset); note
   which of `Destroy_0`, `ClearPersistSkill`, `BuffRemove` moved.
6. `tgprobe reset`; press the **non-toggle** skill once → the Q1 row must also
   move (it is a cast) and the Q2/Q3 signals must **not** appear, or appear
   and vanish within its own effect life (record how long).
7. **Negative control, Purgatory off**: switch loadout / reset sub-skill
   points / swap to the second character; `tgprobe reset`; press Soul Spurn
   once; `tgprobe abilities` at 1 s, 3 s, 10 s → the effect must end on its
   own; record its life in seconds and which row (`Destroy_0`,
   `StepAbilityParentDestroyTimer` args, `Alarm_0`) ended it. Restore
   Purgatory. If not feasible, write the reason in Results.
8. `tgprobe reset`; press Soul Spurn (Purgatory) twice as fast as possible →
   Q5: the Q1 row reads 2 with `lastGap` of a few frames, and the toggle ends
   off. Then press once to turn it on again.
9. Hold the Soul Spurn key for 1 s → Q5: does the Q1 row stream per frame?
10. **Zone change (Q6)**: with the toggle ON, `tgprobe room` (record the old
    key), `tgprobe reset`, take a waypoint/portal. As soon as the new zone is
    playable: `tgprobe show` — read the `room=` key (must differ from the
    recorded one), `hudSinceRoomChange=` (the first-frame count), and which of
    `White_Mage_Soul_Spurn_obj` `Destroy_0` / `CleanUp_0`,
    `ClearPersistSkill`, `BuffRemove`, `RoomGoto` moved — then
    `tgprobe abilities`, `tgprobe buffs`, `tgprobe room`. There is no Room
    End row (see "Static search"); do not add one. The state read must be
    OFF here. Press Soul Spurn once → it must turn ON as a fresh cast.
11. If Q2 and Q3 are both empty after 4–7: `tgprobe snap global`, repeat 4–5
    with `tgprobe diff`; read the verbose `TalentUse` / `CheckTalentUse` /
    `GetSubTalentInfo` return values. If still empty: **Ghidra fallback** —
    `citrace symdump` (in a separate session, since `citrace` is excluded from
    this one), `tools/ghidra/ImportSymbols.java`, read `TalentsWhiteMage`'s
    Soul Spurn branch locally for the sub-talent check and what it sets, and
    write only the *paraphrased* mechanism and the variable/argument name it
    reads into this doc.

Paste every quoted line into Results; fill status per Q; write
Decision. Stop the game; nothing else is left running.

## Results

Not yet run. Status is exactly one of `measured`, `not observed`, `blocked`.
A `not observed` row quotes both controls' counts from the same `tgprobe show`;
a Q whose candidate rows all read `blocked` or `not found` is `blocked`, never
`not observed`.

| Q | Question | status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Which routine runs once per toggle press, with what `self` and args | | |
| Q2 | What distinguishes a Purgatory-toggled Soul Spurn from the same skill without Purgatory, and from a non-toggle skill | | |
| Q3 | Where the on/off state lives, whether it stays flipped while on, and whether one read from the draw hook can see it | | |
| Q4 | Where the slots draw: whether `DrawHudBuffs` runs after `DrawHudAbilityButtons`, slot geometry, which slot variable names the talent | | |
| Q5 | Whether an accidental double-press is two cast calls, and whether a held key streams calls | | |
| Q6 | What a zone change does to the state and in what order; is the state OFF on the first `DrawHudBuffs` in the new zone | | |

## Decision

Not yet made. Track A (re-cast guard) needs Q1 + a discriminator from Q2 or Q3
+ Q5; Track B (active indicator) needs Q3 + Q4 + Q6. Each track is recorded
here as `GO` with the routine / state read / anchor named, or `BLOCKED` with
the question it failed.
